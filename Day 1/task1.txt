Difference between HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1

What is HTTP?

HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication.
 By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user.
 There are several stages of development of HTTP but we will focus mainly on 
 HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.

HTTP 1.1 Protocol

• It was released in 1997.
• It uses text based commands for HTTP requests.
• It added many performance enhancements e.g. caching, request pipelining, keepalive connections, transfer
 encoding, byte range requests etc.
• It can load one requests at a time. Hence one request per one TCP connection is possible.

HTTP 2 Protocol

• It was released in Feb. 2015 by IERF.
• It is binary and not textual.
• It is fully multiplexed.
• It interleaves multiple requests/responses in parallel without blocking on anyone.
• It uses single TCP connection to deliver multiple requests/responses (in parallel).
• It uses header compression in order to reduce overhead.
• It allows servers to "push" responses into client caches proactively.
• It removes unnecessary HTTP/1.x work-arounds e.g. Image sprites, domain sharing etc.
• It is less error prone than HTTP/1.
